# phenomic-bones

a bare skeleton [Phenomic](https://github.com/MoOx/phenomic) theme

includes a minimal [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) implementation in src/redux.js, based on the [Ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) format (implementation in the src/components/Header component)

this was only designed for my own personal use, but I hope it may be useful enough for you to use
